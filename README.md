# Spinning Particles — Mesmerizing 3D Particle Animation by Deividas Strole

Spinning Particles is a captivating WebGL particle animation built with **Three.js**. Created by Deividas Strole, this project features thousands of particles rotating in 3D space, forming dynamic, hypnotic patterns—perfect for backgrounds, visual effects demos, or exploring Three.js capabilities.

This lightweight, single-file (or minimal structure) demo runs smoothly in the browser and showcases particle systems, animation loops, and camera controls in Three.js.

Developed by Deividas Strole as part of his portfolio, it highlights creative use of 3D graphics on the web.

🚀 Overview

Watch particles spin and flow in a beautiful 3D formation. The animation uses Three.js to render a custom particle geometry with continuous rotation, subtle depth effects, and responsive rendering. Orbit controls allow interaction (if enabled), or it runs as a seamless ambient animation.

Built by Deividas Strole to demonstrate efficient particle handling and real-time 3D rendering in the browser.

✨ Key Features

- Thousands of particles in smooth spinning motion
- Custom particle positioning and rotation animation
- Responsive canvas that fills the screen
- Lightweight and performant using Three.js best practices
- Interactive orbit controls (optional)
- No external dependencies beyond Three.js
